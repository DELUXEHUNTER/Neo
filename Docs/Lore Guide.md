This guide is used to tell you how you may contribute to the lore of the game, having the restrictions and basics of whats allowed and whats not allowed. As well as some of the formating for each entry. This is very basic for now in the future it will get more advanced and clear, but I'm not the best at writing or grammar. 

 **Additions:**
<br>
 Adding to or adding a entry is something thats allowed and even encouraged to do so as long as you have an idea or thought you like and want to exist than you can. So long as it does not contradict an earlier made entry, doesn't make sense, or is not somewhat related to the story/setting of the story. It is a very good idea that you do read at least most of the lore.
 
 Anything you think of can be added so long as it follows the guidelines. Yes this even means your own kingdoms! 

**Rewrites:**
<br>
 Sometimes there are entries that aren't clear or don't make sense but do have a good meaning this means that an entry should be rewritten for more clarity and better explanation, rewriting an entry is not to change any of the content but write it in a different way but with the same meaning that conveys the information in a way that has more readablty and is more clear. This is one of the most helpful ways for you to contribute alongside adding to/adding entries. Really any kind of contribution is welcome.

**Extra:**
<br>
 There are many entries within these files that may not be entirely complete or have a lot to them. These would also be another big help if you could add to these entries especially any entries not directly relating to the Neoan kingdom because we do want the world to be filled with lore but the main focus is Neoa.
 <!--This somewhat does not apply to the very future of this game we do plan on including everything here inside of the game but as time goes on it'll be harder to incorporate certain things in the game. -->
 Most entries within these files are going to be included in the game at some point either in books found in the game or through characters, items, objects, ect.... So if you add an entry we will try our best to include it at some point especially now at the very early stages

 Something that would be an extremely big help would be if someone would add dates to everything to make the lore easier to write and understand.
