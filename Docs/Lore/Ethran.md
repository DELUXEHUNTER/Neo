Ethran is a world filled with many legendary creatures, mythologies, mysteries and legends, massive kingdoms with cities, towns, and unique people. After the sun disappeared from the sky the world was set into an eternal darkness, 
entirely unknown how the sun disappeared this has caused many people to speculate that the creatures who were born under the grace of the darkness had caused it. Due to these creatures being some of the only to benefit from the suns disappearence, this had also led to the persecution of these creatures despite it not being their inherent nature to be evil most people of Ethran believe this, its just the sad truth that they might never be considered innocent. despite being eternally night the denizens of Ethran have created many new methods to protect themselves from the creatures such as a similar magic to sun magic that does not require the suns energies to function, lanterns and other lights are set up to repel vampires and other creatures who cannot be near sunlight, and there are guards in towns and cities patroling at all times despite these measures they do not always work and deaths do still happen, as these methods are not perfect.
<br>
Ethran is both extremely advanced but simple too having many technologies and other advancements while still having medieval mindsets. Time is measured in a slightly different way, there are still days and months aswell as years but a year is measured using terms, for example the starting date of the game is Monday, September 1st, Apafi. Apafi is considered the very first year due to the years being a more recent invention
<!--
There are many similarities to the realm world there may not be many of them but there are a few. In order to make the time system easier, days, weeks, and months are used while years are replaced with terms. An example is the starting date. Monday, September 1st, Apafi. Apafi is considered year 01, being the first year ever counted. Past years were not counted in any way there were only months and days.

### Dimensions/Realms
These are the alternate realms and dimensions of Ethran all connected somehow.

**Aonis,<br>Liminal Realm**
<br>
Aonis is a realm filled with mysteries and mind bending landscapes almost completely impossible for a normal human undead or alive, to navigate. The main purpose for this realm existing is used as a prison while its secondary purpose is used as a way to travel between locations and several other dimensions of Ethran, including the dream realm. Its extremely dangerous to travel within due to its hostile ecosystem and animals, alongside its extremely unpredictable landscape and pathways. Aonis is used to imprison beings of all races and power levels typically they are beings who have enraged gods or powerful magic beings, not even any of the gods have dominion over this realm. Magic used within Aonis is extremely volatile and almost uncastable and is very difficult for any being not native to the realm. 
Magic used to travel between realms including versions of astral project are entirely unuseable to exit, enter or travel around Aonis as if it was easily useable just any creature could escape its grasp. There are not many ways to exit or leave Aonis, but the only ways are to be pulled inside by one of the Jailors of the realm. Or through entering the gateway, if you have been pulled within the realm it will be very difficult for you to escape. The other way to exit or enter are through the many gateways located within the realm and outside of it.

Aonis is considered the first realm of hell due to many dead souls ending up tortured here wandering forever and to it being the only way to access the other hells.

**Vastille**
<br><!-- The god does not have a name yet but possible names are, Vastille named after his realm, or Aze.-->
Vastille is the hellish death realm that every mortal ends up in. Ruled over by a once loving and kind god who became corrupted after a creature entered his realm ruining everything, this creatured entered his mind driving him insane, before his corruption the god of Vastille was once loving and kind and his realm was beautiful and the only place mortals had hoped to end up in. Now it is a hellish landscape with no beauty only pain and mortal terror, it is one of the four realms of hell considered the second realm that you could end up in and is possibly the worst of the four hells. Many of the worst and most powerful demons have made their home inside Vastille being one of the many reasons it is the worst hell to end up. 

There are still parts of Vastille that have retained their beauty and some mortal souls can find their way here to be under the protection of its remaining uncorrupted Angelic creatures who ensure that it remains beautiful and peaceful, these creatures hold onto the belief that one day their god will be returned to sanity and the creature influencing his mind, will disappear or die completely.

**Astera**
<br><!--I don't know what to do for this one-->
Astera is the third hell out of the four hells.


**Dream Realm**
<br><!--I don't have many ideas for this -->
The dream realm is a collection of every dream of almost every being where they reside and form, there are no beings that truly govern over the dream realm, as each dream is considered its own subrealm or division/domain within the realm. While no being truly govern the realm beings with suffecient power like demons, or deities could influence it, or another creatures dream, each dream has its own unique properties depending on the mind of the dreamer or the influence that cause the dream such as magic, environment, ect.. Its very rarely possible to lose control over your own dream, but typically this means you must have control over your dream at first most dreamers are unaware of this possibility. Demons or other entities that enter your dream can possibly influence your dreams and turn them into nightmares, or take entire control of your dream.
Mortals typically do not know much about the dream realm and its very rare they even know of the existence of the realm outside of their typical dream. Traveling to the dream realm is very easy through the right means, astral projection is typically the most common and safest but it is possible to transport your physical body into a dream. But physically traveling has several consequences having your physical body means that you are capable of truly dying inside of the realm, it also takes a heavy toll on your mind and body if you do travel. Its recommended that if you do travel you are well experienced and strong willed. Otherwise you should not be going into the dream realm. Just as the realm Aonis is unpredictable so is the dream realm in some cases even more than Aonis.

### Events

<!--Unfinished, in need of ideas/a writer-->
**Anaxian collapse**
<br>
This event happened December 1st, Thursday, Pre-Apafi one month before the begining of apafi. This event was extremely unexpected and only came about due to the extreme boldness of the criminal warlords who seized control of the entire nation from the king. The Anaxian warlords took the nation in exactly four months, taking advantage of several skirmishes that happened between Anaxian and Neoan army divisions aswell as their own ability to infiltrate and destory, to quickly decimate the Anaxian armies and take control from the royal Authority that ruled over Anaxia at the beginning.

**Lexian II,<br>Lord/King of Neoa.**
<br><!-- Entire rewrite wanted -->
Lexian is the second king in his family to ever be king and is the youngest Neoan to ever be crowned. He was given his grown at the age of 14 after his fathers mysterious disappearence, in the current day he is 24. Lexian has become very well known for his many improvements and changes inside of the Neoan kingdom including redefining the way the economy, military, and government is structured and regulated. Introducing several regulations and laws that have brought Neoan citizens safer lives and a more stable government and economy, making him an extremely loved leader. Not much is known about him to the mainstream population due to his royal status meaning he is not very well personally known by many people except for those who directly finds an interest in, or specifically his family. He has survived four assasination attempts by Anaxian revolutionaries.

**Kain Sovin,<br>Royal Guardsmen**
<br>
Kain Sovin is the royal guard the king entrusts his life to and always has for several times. He is sometimes a very kind and gentle person while others being one of the cruelest people. He is very loyal to the Neoan crown. Despite being born inside of Neoa Kain is considered an Anaxian by many people and as is subject to a lot of cruelty due to being an Anaxian who has allied himself with the royalty of Neoa.

**Dex,<br>The Bounty Hunter**
<br>
Dex is one of the highly skilled bounty hunters within Ethran credited with claiming some of the most dangerous and notorious bounties within Ethran. He is very well known and respected within most kingdoms, and their cities, its unknown how he gained a large reputation as one of the most respected bounty hunters despite being the most arrogant and rude Anaxians to exist. Its suspected that Dex has several ties to the Anaxian revolutionaries, but this is entirely unknown and possibly false due to Dex being known to work for the Neoan government several times in the past. This is either due to him being entirely motivated by greed or having no politicial connections. 


**Ancient Ancestors**
<br>
These are the ancestors who almost all people within Ethran share within their blood through distant or direct connections.

**Avalon,<br>Neoan Lord**
<br><!--Unremovable-->
Avalon is the founder and first king of Neoa being the greatest king in Neoan History, he has been immortalized in Neoan history through thousands of stories and legends told over hundreds of years even being considered an Anaxian hero in some parts of Anaxia, and Neoa. Several Neoans are directly related to him through distant connections and few through direct. Avalon did not die, he disappeared one day. Its unknown where he went but many speculate he entered the realm of Aonis and stayed there, but this is almost impossible to prove as no one has ever explored Aonis to this extent, or ever even spoken to the beings that reside there.  

**Iedelan,<br>Anaxian hero**
<br><!--Needs Lore-->
Iedelan is the most famous hero within Anaxia, he is known for slaying demons and many other immortal creatures within Anaxia, Iedelan is said to have been named after a god by the same name. 

**Tau-an,<br>The Undead.**
<br><!--Idea Entry-->
Tau-an is the immortal undead ancestor of almost all things dead. He is considered the very first undead aswell as creator and master of the first undead beings, until being overthrown by the very creatures he raised from the dead. The more he experimented with necromancy the more powerful beings he was capable of creating, such as vampires, eventually he became capable of create new life from death, each time he raised the dead he lost more and more of his sanity as he began surrounding himself by these creatures pushing himself away from the living until his eventual passing where he brought himself back from the dead. Its said that he is contained within the realm of Aonis. But its unknown where he actually is located or living within. Undead do not follow his lordship otherwise he would've been freed. Some people believe that Tau-an is the original human, but this is a widely disproven theory and is completely false.


**Deities, Demons, Angels, ect...**
<br>
These are the powerful beings of Ethran.
