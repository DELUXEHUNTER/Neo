The Kingdom of Neoa. Sometimes known as the Aedonian Kingdom or greater Aedon depending on the region you are in. It is one of the most prominent and largest kingdoms within Ethran, due to its many advancements in its society, and government meaning it is the most well established kingdom. Even perfecting the magic used to mimic the sun protecting people from the creatures born from the grace of darkness. Neoa has many different landscapes with unique creatures and legendary beings, alongside its rich history filled with wars, adventures, and many great heroes since before the founding of the capital city, Aedon. Neoa has the most well established legal, economic, political and militaristic structures/systems. While having a court system, law enforcers have the ability to sentence criminals to some kind of punishment. The government of Neoa is split into several different divisions while not technically a federal monarchy the kingdom is divided in the same way a federal government is, while not having governers over states, cities and towns are able to pass and enforce their own local laws while still following Royal law or technically federal law.

The kingdom is very advanced for its time and uses terms and systems from the IRL modern times(Because it just makes me write better plus fantasy)

**Aedon**
<br>
Aedon is the founding city of Neoa built by the original Neoan King Avalon to this day it remains the capital and largest city within Neoa as well as the home of every Royal Neoan Family to ever have been on the thrown. Aedon is split into several different districts. Due to its high status it Neoa has been considered The Kingdom of Aedon, or greater Aedon and has become the main headquarters for many guilds, organizatons, instituations, ect.. The law inside of Aedon is more strict than most other cities or regions within Neoa due to its status and significance executions are not uncommon, but they are only for criminals who have been put through the Neoan court system.

**Neth**
<br>
Neth is the city directly next to Aedon, sometimes considered a district of Aedon, it is directly next to the capital city and shares the exact same leadership of the royal family, and all laws are the same. 


**Aedonian Royal Guard**
<br>
The Aedonian Royal Guard is the first and highly elite division of the royal guard they have been around since the founding of Aedon, they have been said to have had roots in the four knights that were knighted by the first king Avalon, and given the status of Royal Knights, they then founded the royal order of Aedon and swore their loyalty to the crown of Aedon. On the very first of january this division was given orders to protect the city of Aedon after an attack from the Anaxians, they were outnumbers there were only 200 of them and 700 Anaxians. It was a long battle and eventually they succesfully turned 700 Anaxians into 400 dead men, while only 50 Aedonians died in that battle.  

**Dead Sun Order**
<br>
The Dead Sun Order is a radical order of Humans made up of many ethnicities and other people from the many kingdoms of Ethran with their two main goals being the eradication of all non human races from the realm, specifically all creatures born under the grace of the darkness. There are several sects within this order attemtping to obtain these goals through different means, the order is highly secretive and not many people know of its existence and they actively want this to be the case. Many of the orders activities are directly confused for the group of Anaxian revolutionaries or that they are a sect of this order, this is not true and its unknown if this mistake is purposefully part of the facade set by the order to redirect the blame from their actions. Its considered impossible to tell how many members of this order exist but it is a massive order.
