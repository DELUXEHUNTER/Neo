Welcome I hope you enjoy reading or adding to the lore of Neoa. The lore might not be the best, but we are going to try our best to keep the lore followable and easily readable without the least amount of confusion in explanations. Most lore entries within this file are ideas made or suggested by the community, and our plan is to include most lore here inside of the game in either books found or through exposure by characters, items, or other means. The main problem with writing the lore is the difficulty formatting it to look eye-pleasing and easier to read, so if you want, we could really use help with lore writing and formatting. It would be a massive amount of help for us. Certain characters, places, nations, objects, or races won't have full entries if they are going to be explained throughout the game this helps keep some of the lore of the game a secret and is actually worth playing by exposing lore throughout it.

  Additions, Edits, and removals:
Anyone who is interested in writing lore can, there are not many restrictions to adding  or editing lore as long as you follow the established lore in other lore entries, or if your entry does not contradict another earlier made entry. Its recommended before writing/editing/adding lore you read the other entries. Certain lore entries cannot be removed as it would require an entire rewrite to everything within the game, removing entries is usually not allowed at all but if its neccesary you may ask, or if its a very recent entry that YOU wrote you can as long as its not been solidified in the game code. 

  Rewrites:
Rewriting lore entries, is entirely allowed and actually encouraged. Rewriting an entry is just simply writing them in another way while having the same meaning an example would be writing "I had a comment" to "I used to have a comment", or another form similar but more formal and easier to understand. 

  Explained in game Entries:
These are lore entries that will be explained through playing the game and are typically the entries written by Major contributers.

  Notice: 
Some of these entries are going to mark unchangeable or editable meaning you will not be able to edit or change them anymore this typically will only happen after an entry has been completely solidified, in order for an entry to be considered solidified it has to be included within the game and have other entries based on it, an entry can also be considered solidified if it has multiple entries based on it included within the game, or just having several entries included. This does not mean that the entry is loosely based on the original, it means that the entry has to have an explicit connection to it.

### Background
Lands of Neoa is based in a world called Ethran<!---Temporary name and is subject to change-->. A world filled with many creatures, monsters, mythologies, mysteries, and legends, as well as massive kingdoms, cities, towns, and unique people. The world is set in an entirely dark world after a mysterious force caused the sun to disappear from the sky, putting the world into an eternal darkness. It is unknown what caused this to happen, but it has caused many people to despise creatures born under the grace of darkness. These creatures include the obvious ones like vampires, zombies, skeletons, and, in some cases, werewolves, ect..  Due to them being more active since gaining a massive advantage, the night is neverending. This led the people of Ethran to create new ways or methods to protect themselves from these creatures using magic to create a kind of version of sun magic that does not require the energies of the sun to function, to repel these creatures, and to ensure they do not harm them in their sleep. These ways are very effective, but they do not always protect people, and people do occasionally lose their lives to these creatures. Many of these creatures are not inherently evil and are just painted as if they live an evil life. Leading to the persecution of creatures born from the darkness's grace. because this is sadly the view of these creatures the people of Ethran have There are some similarities to the real world, there may not be many, but there are a few. In order to make the time system easier, days, weeks, and months are used, while years are replaced with terms, like the beginning date of the entire game being Monday, September 1st, Apafi. Apafi is considered year 01 due to it being the only year actually counted past years were only counted by using the months and days without numbering them.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### The Kingdom of Neoa
Neoa, sometimes referred to as the Aedonian Kingdom, or greater Aedon in some cases, is the largest and most prominent kingdom within the world of Ethran, due to its many advancements in its government and society, becoming the most well-established kingdom within the realm of Ethran, and even perfecting the magic used in place of the sun. Neoa is filled with several different unique terrains and legendary creatures, ect... Neoa has a very rich history filled with wars, adventures, and many great heroes since before the founding of the king. The culture of Neoa is a blend of the cultures of the surrounding nations and regions,  having very advanced economic, political, and millitaristic systems, having a well-established bank system, mail, and newspapers [not called newspapers], ect... Neoa does not have a very strict legal structure, and the law is mostly only enforced within cities and major towns while having a court system as well. This does not mean that any citizen is allowed to do whatever they want outside of these places, but those are where the law is mainly enforced by the guards. Most cities within Neoa have their own separate laws.

#### Aedon
Aedon is both the capital and the very first city that was founded in Neoa, built by the original Neoan king Avalon. To this day, it remains the largest and richest city within Neoa, filled with history from even before its creation, and it even remains home to the Royal Neoan Families that have ruled over Neoa. Aedon has some of the strictest laws due to it being the capital and home to the royal Neoan family. It also has more experienced guards that patrol its streets.

### Anaxia
<!-- I don't know what to write for anaxia and I think it'd be better if someone else writes something for it due to my inability to think of any ideas -->

### Dimensions/Realms

<!----A lot of these realms are just ideas and these entries aren't really going to be the best, these would be nice for someone to help write -->

Aonis is a realm of mysteries and mind bending landscapes, it is used as a way to travel quickly between dimensions and places, almost impossible to navigate without help from some kind of guide or help in any kind of form either human, animal, or object, it is filled with creatures of many different kinds and is also extremely dangerous and is even used as a prison in some cases with its own guards its unknown what these creatures are called or what their purpose is but its known that they are very dangerous and they are the jailors of the beings imprisoned in Aonis. Magic inside of Aonis is very volatile and typically impossible to cast most types of magics, its almost impossible to use any kind of transportation magics here to enter or exit this realm, the only way to exit Aonis is through one of its gateways, and the only way to enter Aonis is by being dragged in by a jailor or through an gateway, its unknown how the realm was created but it is known how dangerous it is by almost all magic users. Some animals born in Aonis are given the natural ability to travel between Aonis and Ethran


#### Dream Realm
The Dream realm is the realm that all dreams of almost every being, resides and forms, there are no forces that truly can control the dream realm. Instead it is influenced by itself and its magic wielders in the forms of demons, dreamwalkers, and deities. The dream realm is very unique in the sense that its not considered its own realm but instead a collection of dreams. Each dream has its own distinct properties always unique depending on the mind of the dreamer and the influences that caused the dream. Typically a dreamer has full control over their dream but it is possible to lose control over your dream, in most cases this means a demonic entity of some kind has entered your dream or mind, or has a presence around you. Not much is known about the dream realm by mortals and its very rare that a mortal even knows of the existence of the dream realm outside of the typical dreams. It is almost impossible for a user to fully die within the dream realm unless they have brought their physical body or if the entity that is attacking you has mass amounts of power.
