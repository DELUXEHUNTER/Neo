<h1 align="Center"> Writing Guide</h1>
<p align="justify">Welcome, I hope you enjoy reading or adding to the lore! It might not be the best but we will try our hardest to keep the lore easily followable without too much confusion. You can add anything you would like to the lore as long as you stick to the theme and story of the world, its suggested you read at least a few of the other lore entries specifically. Most of the lore entries added to this file will be included within the game at some point. It might take some time for more recent entries to be added but thats to be expected when you have to rewrite the code in order to include something. 
<br>
In order to avoid overwhelming readers, and the writers alike if this file begins to become too large, or a better way to put it, has too many entries and it takes too long to scroll to find a specific entry the file will be split up into multiple others, each being their own category.  if you'd like to help something that we could really use is more lore writers, and someone to format this to make it easier to read and comprehend.

<h3>Background</h3>

<p align="justify">The world of [PlaceHolder] is one filled with many creatures, mysteries, mythologies and legends, massive kingdoms, cities, towns, and even people. The world is set into an eternal night, its completely unknown who, or what caused the night to last this long. But it has been this way for hundreds of years, vampires and other creatures of the night became more active due to their need to hide from daylight or the need for the moon to access their powers, this caused the people of [PlaceHolder] to create new ways, new methods, to protect themselves and keep these creatures from harming them in their sleep or other ways. They eventually figured out a way to mimic the sunlight, similar to sun magic, but does not require the energy from the sun to access and use. Typically some creatures, the not inherently evil ones are allowed to be left alone and even have normal lives, while inhrently evil creatures, like vampires, werewolves are usually persecuted and judged more harshly. Not all creatures born from the night, or who live within its grace are evil[including zombies, and skeletons]. But this is the view that most people have sadly. 
<br> 
There are many similarities to the real world in this world, but not many, to make it easier this game uses the dates and months, aswell as days of the real world, like monday, january, ect... the only difference in this system is the year, the years are given specific terms. The current starting date is September, Friday the 1st, in the year Apafi, Apafi is known as year 01, throughout this game the year and day may change obviously otherwise how would the story even progress. It wouldn't unless this was about a time loop that changed slightly each time you relived it, but thats not what this game is, if I'm being honest I don't even know what this game is, all I know is we're gonna have fun making it and hopefully you playing it.</p>
