<h1 align="Center"> Writing Guide</h1>
<p align="justify">Welcome, I hope you enjoy reading or adding to the lore! It might not be the best but we will try our hardest to keep the lore easily followable without too much confusion. You can add anything you would like to the lore as long as you stick to the theme and story of the world, its suggested you read at least a few of the other lore entries specifically. Most of the lore entries added to this file will be included within the game at some point. It might take some time for more recent entries to be added but thats to be expected when you have to rewrite the code in order to include something. 
<br>
In order to avoid overwhelming readers, and the writers alike if this file begins to become too large, or a better way to put it, has too many entries and it takes too long to scroll to find a specific entry the file will be split up into multiple others, each being their own category.  if you'd like to help something that we could really use is more lore writers, and someone to format this to make it easier to read and comprehend.

<h3>Background</h3>

<p align="justify">The world of [PlaceHolder] is one filled with many creatures, mysteries, mythologies and legends, massive kingdoms, cities, towns, and even people. The world is set into an eternal night, its completely unknown who, or what caused the night to last this long. But it has been this way for hundreds of years, vampires and other creatures of the night became more active due to their need to hide from daylight or the need for the moon to access their powers, this caused the people of [PlaceHolder] to create new ways, new methods, to protect themselves and keep these creatures from harming them in their sleep or other ways. They eventually figured out a way to mimic the sunlight, similar to sun magic, but does not require the energy from the sun to access and use. Typically some creatures, the not inherently evil ones are allowed to be left alone and even have normal lives, while inhrently evil creatures, like vampires, werewolves are usually persecuted and judged more harshly. Not all creatures born from the night, or who live within its grace are evil[including zombies, and skeletons]. But this is the view that most people have sadly. 
<br> 
There are many similarities to the real world in this world, but not many, to make it easier this game uses the dates and months, aswell as days of the real world, like monday, january, ect... the only difference in this system is the year, the years are given specific terms. The current starting date is September, Friday the 1st, in the year Apafi, Apafi is known as year 01, throughout this game the year and day may change obviously otherwise how would the story even progress. It wouldn't unless this was about a time loop that changed slightly each time you relived it, but thats not what this game is, if I'm being honest I don't even know what this game is, all I know is we're gonna have fun making it and hopefully you playing it.</p>

<h3>Neoa</h3>
<p align="justify">The kingdom of Neoa, sometimes refered to as greater Aedon. Is the largest most prominent kingdom within the world of [PlaceHolder] due to it being the most well adjusted kingdom due to the lack of a sun perfecting the magic used in order to mimic the sun and protect themselves from Nightcreatures, having many creatures, different terrains, ect... being the youngest kingdom Neoa still has a very rich history filled with wars, adventures, and great heroes since even before the founding of the kingdom, the government of Neoa is heavily influenced by the Church of Aedon and the culture of Neoa is a blend of surrounding cultures, and based within the many regions.</p> 


<h4>Aedon</h4>
<p align="justify">Aedon has always been the capital and largest city within Neoa being the very first city founded by Avalon, and is home to the royal Neoan family. Filled with years of ancient Neoan and Anaxian history from after and even before the city was founded and built to be what it is today. Due to Aedon being the capital the law is much more strict than any other city, and has many more laws, aswell as more experienced guardsmen/police. </p>

<h4>Aedonian Wolf</h4>
<p align="justify">
I don't think this story is good but here
<br>
The story of the Aedonian wolf of Avalon, it was said that when the Neoan legend Avalon first arrived in the primitive region of Aedon he had found a lone wolf cub, taking it in and raising it like one of his pets, and sometimes even treating it like a child Avalon raised the wolf cub into a fierce but gentle wolf. Since Avalons disappearence from the world the wolf has been searching for him with its own pack, never ending its search, never resting until it has found him. Even now the wolf still hunts today forever searching, some have seen this great wolf and praised it. In recent years the wolf has been shown to be sweet while als some stories a monster.
<br>
The boy and wolf. A young boy by the name of Aaron, wandering throughout the woods after swearing he wished his parents were dead, his parents were not even searching for the boy, eventually he found himself lost, alone, and scared, hunted by the creatures of the night after almost being completely ripped apart by a vampire, the boy was saved when a wolf pulled the vampire away from him, the vampires flesh began to burn as if sunlight had touched him his wounds becoming worse every second, eventually fleeing from the fight realizing that the wolf had done something to him. The wolf comforted the boy and picked him up carrying him back to his home and gently placing him within the arms of his parents, warning them that they should never let a boy wander in the woods at night, alone in the dark.
