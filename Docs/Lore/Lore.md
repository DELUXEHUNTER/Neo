<h1 align="Center"> Writing Guide</h1>
<p align="justify">Welcome, I hope you enjoy reading or adding to the lore! It might not be the best but we will try our hardest to keep the lore easily followable without too much confusion. You can add anything you would like to the lore as long as you stick to the theme and story of the world, its suggested you read at least a few of the other lore entries specifically. Most of the lore entries added to this file will be included within the game at some point. It might take some time for more recent entries to be added but thats to be expected when you have to rewrite the code in order to include something. 
<br>
In order to avoid overwhelming readers, and the writers alike if this file begins to become too large, or a better way to put it, has too many entries and it takes too long to scroll to find a specific entry the file will be split up into multiple others, each being their own category.  if you'd like to help something that we could really use is more lore writers, and someone to format this to make it easier to read and comprehend.
