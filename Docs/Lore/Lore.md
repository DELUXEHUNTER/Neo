Welcome I hope you enjoy reading or adding to the lore of Neoa. The lore might not be the best, but we are going to try our best to keep the lore followable and easily readable without the least amount of confusion in explanations. Most lore entries within this file are ideas made or suggested by the community, and our plan is to include most lore here inside of the game in either books found or through exposure by characters, items, or other means. 
The main problem with writing the lore is the difficulty formatting it to look eye-pleasing and easier to read, so if you want, we could really use help with lore writing and formatting. It would be a massive amount of help for us. Certain characters, places, nations, objects, or races won't have full entries if they are going to be explained throughout the game this helps keep some of the lore of the game a secret and is actually worth playing by exposing lore throughout it.

Almost every entry within this are going to be written like they were written before the starting date of the game[September 1st Monday, Apafi(01).]. Entries meant specifically for Neoa will have more lore due to Neoa being the main setting of the story.
<!-- 
READ IF YOU PLAN ON CONTRIBUTING LORE EXPLAINS HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO LORE:

  Additions and Edits:
Anyone interested in writing lore is completely allowed to and even encouraged to do so. There aren't many restrictions to doing this as long as your entry follows the established story from other entries, your entry doesn't contradict another earlier made entry. Its recommended you read other entries before editing, or adding to lore, as this will help avoid making mistakes that could cause your entry to be removed/declined. 

  Rewrites:
Rewriting an entry is acceptable and encouraged to give an entry more clarity by semple rewriting them in another way, while giving it the same meaning for example, "I originally thought" to "At first I thought" which keeps its meaning while being writen in a completely different way either more formally or just to be more understandable.

  Explained in game Entries:
These are lore entries that will be explained through playing the game and are typically the entries written by Major contributers.

  Restrictions:
Entries that have been used as a base for several others cannot be changed or removed without permission, due to the fact that if you change something in an entry that several were based on would cause confusion and they wouldn't make sense. As removing an integral part of something could cause it to collapse. Adding an entry is typically completely acceptable as long as you remain on topic by following the rest of the story and other lore entries, meaning you might have to read at least the background and some of the Neoan Kingdom entry.

  Notes/Things:
Its completely acceptable if you would like to create kingdoms and other places within the world to fill the world with even more lore again as long as you stick to the main themes.

These instructions or this guide will be rewritten and eventually updated into a final form for now this is the basis for everything.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### Background
Lands of Neoa is based in a world called Ethran<!---Temporary name and is subject to change-->. A world filled with many creatures, monsters, mythologies, mysteries, and legends, as well as massive kingdoms, cities, towns, and unique people. The world is set in an entirely dark world after a mysterious force caused the sun to disappear from the sky, putting the world into an eternal darkness. It is unknown what caused this to happen, but it has caused many people to despise creatures born under the grace of darkness. These creatures include the obvious ones like vampires, zombies, skeletons, and, in some cases, werewolves, ect..Â  Due to them being more active since gaining a massive advantage, the night is neverending. This led the people of Ethran to create new ways or methods to protect themselves from these creatures using magic to create a kind of version of sun magic that does not require the energies of the sun to function, to repel these creatures, and to ensure they do not harm them in their sleep. These ways are very effective, but they do not always protect people, and people do occasionally lose their lives to these creatures. Many of these creatures are not inherently evil and are just painted as if they live an evil life. Leading to the persecution of creatures born from the darkness's grace. 
Because this is sadly the view of these creatures the people of Ethran have There are some similarities to the real world, there may not be many, but there are a few. In order to make the time system easier, days, weeks, and months are used, while years are replaced with terms, like the beginning date of the entire game being Monday, September 1st, Apafi. Apafi is considered year 01 due to it being the only year actually counted past years were only counted by using the months and days without numbering them.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### The Kingdom of Neoa
<!-- Rewrite for clarity and just better writing NEEDED -->
The kingdom of Neoa, or sometimes known as the Aedonian Kingdom and even greater Aedon depending on the region. Is one of the largest and most prominent kingdoms within Ethran. Due to its many advancements in its society and government, becoming the most well-established kingdom, even perfecting the magic that is used to mimic the sun protecting the people from creatures born from the night. Neoa has many different landscapes with unique creatures and legendary beings, alongside its rich history filled with wars, adventures and many greate heroes since before the founding of Aedon the very first city and capital of Neoa. 
Neoa has some of the most well established legal structures, economic, political and millitaristic systems in Ethran, law is mainly enforced within major cities and towns while having a court system, a guard or other kind of law enforcer has the ability to sentence criminals to some kind of punishment. The government of Neoa is split into several different parts resembling a federal monarchy, while not technically a federal monarchy the kingdom is divided in the same way a federal government is while not having governers or generals over states a city or town is able to pass and enforce their own local laws while following Royal law[Federal law]. 

#### Aedon
Aedon is the very first city founded in the kingdom, founded by the original Neoan king Avalon, to this day it remains the largest and richest city within Neoa aswell as the home of the Royal Neoans Families that have ruled over Neoa. Due to it being the capital city Aedons law is much more strict than most cities or regions within Neoa. Many of the guilds and organizations are based within this city within Neoa are located here.

#### Flame of Aedon[Temp name]
The Flame of Aedon is a radical order of humans made up of Anaxians and many other people from the many kingdoms of Ethran with their sole goals being the eradication of all non human races from the realm, and to bring back the sun. The Order is split up into several sects that are attempting to obtain these goals through different means. <!--Entry not done, the 2 most important sects will be added after given a name, and more lore is needed -->

---------------------------------------------------------------

### Anaxia
<!--I don't know what to write for anaxia and I think it'd be better if someone else writes something for it due to my inability to think of any ideas-->
Anaxia is the kingdom located directly next to Neoa being the third most prominent kingdom within Ethran, having one of the longest and most violent rivalry with Neoa for several years. 




---------------------------------------------------------------
#### Ancient ancestors
These are the ancient ancestors of the people of Ethran that some people have in common with themselves

#### Avalon,<br>Neoan Lord
<!--Unremovable-->
Avalon is the founder and first king of Neoa, being the greatest king in Neoan history. He has been immortalized in Neoan history through thousands of stories told over hundreds of years even being considered an Anaxian hero in some parts of Anaxia, and Neoa. Several Neoans are directly related to him through distant connections and some through very close connections. 

#### Iedelan,<br>Anaxian hero
<!--Needs Lore -->
Iedelan is the most famous Hero in Anaxian history.

#### Tau-an,<br>The Undead.
<!--Idea Entry-->
Tau-an is the Immortal undead ancestor of all things dead, considered the creator aswell as master of the very first dead until being overthrown by the very dead creatures he raised. The more dead he raised the more they learned and gained free will, becoming almost entirely sentient giving themselves thoughs and minds. In certain aspects its said he was the very first vampire while this is not true, Tau-an does have a liking towards them and does keep them in his favor. Tau-an is indirectly the cause of the very first vampire. Shortly after being overthrown Tau-an lost all of his dominion over the undead creatures.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### Dimensions/Realms
The Dimensions Alternate to Ethran, the main dimension
<!----A lot of these realms are just ideas and these entries aren't really going to be the best, these would be nice for someone to help write -->


#### Aonis
Aonis is a realm filled with mysteries and mind bending landscapes almost impossible to navigate normally, used as a way to travel between dimensions and locations, its extremely dangerous to travel within due to its extremely unpredictable nature. its almost impossible to travel without some kind of guide. There are also many creatures and beings within Aonis that are almost as dangerous as its unpredictability. Aonis is used as a prison dimension for beings of any kind deemed too dangerous to be held anywhere else, typically demonic, angelic, or undead.Magic within Aonis is volatile and almost completely unuseable, while still being castable it is very difficult by any being not native to the Aonis realm,
magic used to travel inbetween realms is impossible to cast at all due to the extreme dangers it poses aswell as there being an innate effect barring all travel magic. This means the only way to exit Aonis is to find one of its gateways or to be sent out by one of the jailors. There is also no way to enter aonis without using one of its gateways or again a jailor[idk a name for them yet] pulls you into it, or a very skilled mage


#### Dream Realm
<!--I don't have many ideas for this -->
The Dream realm is the realm that all dreams of almost every being, resides and forms, there are no forces that truly can control the dream realm. Instead it is influenced by itself and its magic wielders in the forms of demons, dreamwalkers, and deities. The dream realm is very unique in the sense that its not considered its own realm but instead a collection of dreams. Each dream has its own distinct properties always unique depending on the mind of the dreamer and the influences that caused the dream. Typically a dreamer has full control over their dream but it is possible to lose control over your dream, in most cases this means a demonic entity of some kind has entered your dream or mind, or has a presence around you. 
Not much is known about the dream realm by mortals and its very rare that a mortal even knows of the existence of the dream realm outside of the typical dreams. It is almost impossible for a user to fully die within the dream realm unless they have brought their physical body or if the entity that is attacking you has mass amounts of power. Not many humans are capable of traveling physically to the dream realm, typically taking a massive toll on their bodies and minds when they do. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

### Characters&Other beings
These are the characters and creatures within Ethran. 


#### The mysterious voice/Mystical Voice
<!--Its possible the voice could be someone important to you? or possibly the one of your ancestors-->
This mysterious voice guides you on your adventure, and rarely speaks to you. Its unknown if its malicious or intends to help you the best it can. 
Until its proven, its best you do what it says without questioning it too much. It goes by many names, typically all variants of The mystical voice. The voice could possibly be all powerful, even giving you life from nothing... or did it take your life?..


#### Lexian II,<br>The King of Neoa.
<!-- Filler Entry, Entire rewrite wanted -->
Lexian II, is the second of his family to become the king of Neoa and the youngest in Neoan history to ever be crowned. Having been given his crown at the young age of 14 after his fathers mysterious disappearence. He is currently 24, and has become well known for his many improvements in the Neoan government including redefining the way all banks are regulated and introducing several laws that have brought Neoan citizens safer lives and better economic stability. Not much else is known about him due to his royal status, meaning he is not very well known personally by many citizens.


#### Dex,<br>The Hunter
Dex is one of the most highly skilled bounty hunters within Ethran he is credited with claiming the bounties of some of the most dangerous and notorious bounties in Ethran. He is very well known and respected within most Kingdoms, and their cities. Its unknown how he gained such a high amount of respect despite being the most arrogant and rude Anaxian to ever exist.
