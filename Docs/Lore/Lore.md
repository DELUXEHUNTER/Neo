Welcome I hope you enjoy reading or adding to the lore of neoa, the lore might not be the best but we are going to try our best to keep the lore followable and easily readable without the least amount of confusion in explanations, most lore entries within this file are ideas made or suggested by the community, our plan is to include most lore here inside of the game in either books found or through exposure by characters, items, or other means. The main problem with writing the lore is the difficulty formating to look eye pleasing and easier to read, so if you want we could really use help lore writing and formatting, it would be a massive amount of help for us.

<!-- 
Additions, Edits, and removals:
Anyone who is interested in writing lore can, there are not many restrictions to adding  or editing lore as long as you follow the established lore in other lore entries, or if your entry does not contradict another earlier made entry. Its recommended before writing/editing/adding lore you read the other entries. Certain lore entries cannot be removed as it would require an entire rewrite to everything within the game, removing entries is usually not allowed at all but if its neccesary you may ask, or if its a very recent entry that YOU wrote you can as long as its not been solidified in the game code. 

Rewrites:
Rewriting lore entries, is entirely allowed and actually encouraged. Rewriting an entry is just simply writing them in another way while having the same meaning an example would be writing "I had a comment" to "I used to have a comment", or another form similar but more formal and easier to understand. 

Notice:
An entry that cannot be changed in any way usually will have a comment or notice that states that the entry is unable to be changed, edited, removed, or added to by anyone except a certain user or person

<h3 align="left">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">The world of Ethran[Placeholdername] is one filled with many creatures, mysteries, mythologies and legends, massive kingdoms, cities, towns, and even people. The world is set into an eternal night, its completely unknown who, or what caused the night to last this long. But it has been this way for hundreds of years, vampires and other creatures of the night became more active due to their need to hide from daylight or the need for the moon to access their powers, this caused the people of Ethran[PlaceHolderName] to create new ways, new methods, to protect themselves and keep these creatures from harming them in their sleep or other ways. They eventually figured out a way to mimic the sunlight, similar to sun magic, but does not require the energy from the sun to access and use. Typically some creatures, the not inherently evil ones are allowed to be left alone and even have normal lives, while inhrently evil creatures, like vampires, werewolves are usually persecuted and judged more harshly. Not all creatures born from the night, or who live within its grace are evil[including zombies, and skeletons]. But this is the view that most people have sadly. 
<br> 
There are many similarities to the real world in this world, but not many, to make it easier this game uses the dates and months, aswell as days of the real world, like monday, january, ect... the only difference in this system is the year, the years are given specific terms. The current starting date is September, Friday the 1st, in the year Apafi, Apafi is known as year 01, throughout this game the year and day may change obviously otherwise how would the story even progress. It wouldn't unless this was about a time loop that changed slightly each time you relived it, but thats not what this game is, if I'm being honest I don't even know what this game is, all I know is we're gonna have fun making it and hopefully you playing it.</p>

---------------------------------------------------------------

<h3 align="left">Neoa</h3>
<p align="justify">The kingdom of Neoa, sometimes refered to as greater Aedon. Is the largest most prominent kingdom within the world of Ethran[PlaceHolderName] due to it being the most well adjusted kingdom due to the lack of a sun perfecting the magic used in order to mimic the sun and protect themselves from Nightcreatures, having many creatures, different terrains, ect... being the youngest kingdom Neoa still has a very rich history filled with wars, adventures, and great heroes since even before the founding of the kingdom, the government of Neoa is heavily influenced by the Church of Aedon and the culture of Neoa is a blend of surrounding cultures, and based within the many regions. Neoa has many similiarities and advancements similar to modern day, like news paper and its bank system.</p> 


<h4>Aedon</h4>
<p align="justify">Aedon has always been the capital and largest city within Neoa being the very first city founded by Avalon, and is home to the royal Neoan family. Filled with years of ancient Neoan and Anaxian history from after and even before the city was founded and built to be what it is today. Due to Aedon being the capital the law is much more strict than any other city, and has many more laws, aswell as more experienced guardsmen/police.</p>



---------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>Anaxia</h3>
<!--Ideas needed-->
<p align="justify">Anaxia is the closest neighbor to Neoa being the second most prominent kingdom within Ethran, and having one of the longest rivalarys with Neoa.</p>


---------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>Factions</h3>
<p align="justify">The Factions of the world.</p>



---------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>Ancient ancestors</h3>
<p align="justify">The Ancient ancestors of the world, being some of the greatest and most mysterious people of the lands.</p>


<h4> Avalon, Neoan Lord</h4>
<p align="justify" >Avalon is the patron of Neoa, He is the founder of Neoa</p>


<h4> Iedelan, Anaxian hero</h4>
<p align="justify">Idelan is the patron of Anaxia, The greatest King in Anaxian history</p>


<h4>Dresden, Traveler of worlds</h4>
<p align="justify">[Dresden is a temporary name and is subject to change, just as is his description]</p>
<p align="justify">A mysterious wandering man who appears at certain times, its unknown why he randomly shows up to certain things, but by many historians in their findings its been noted hes been seen at many important events. No one has ever spoken or seen him. It is known by the world that he still lives to this day.</p>


<h4>Tau-an, The Undead.</h4>
<p align="justify">[Idea?]The Immortal undead ancestor of all things dead. Considered the creator and master of the first undead until having been overthrown by the very dead he raised, as the more he brought back the more they learned and became sentient giving themselves thoughts and minds to use. Not one of the first vampires, but after the vampiric rise he has taken dominion over vampires giving them blessings and everything.</p>


<h3>Dimensions/Realms</h3>
<p align="justify">These are the alternate realms within Ethran[Placeholder name]</p>
<!---A lot of these realms are just ideas and these entries aren't really going to be the best, these would be nice for someone to help write -->
<h4>Aonis</h4>

<p align="justify">Aonis is a prison realm, aswell as a gateway realm. Aonis is one of the most mind bendingly confusing realms with a confusing and almost impossible landscape that is usually extremely difficult to navigate. There are many dangers within Aonis including the wardens/guardians of the realm as well as the prisoners they keep watch over, these beings are usually evil or imprisoned by the gods or the wardens themselves for various reasons, no matter what its advised you don't trust them. Other than being a nightmarish place there are many beautiful animals with unique powers and abilities including some that can travel between dimensions. Magic within Aonis is volatile and only the denizens[creatures born within] of the realm can properly cast. Everything known about this realm are personal experiences of people who have succesfully traveled the realm.</p>


<h4>Dream Realm</h4>
<p align="justify">The dream realm is the place that all of the dreams of all creatures, and people, reside and form, there is no force that controls the dream realm instead and its thought that its entirely influenced by itself and certain magic wielders over generations. An example of these magic wielders are certain deities, demonic entities, and dreamwalkers, ect... The dream realm is unique in the sense that it is more of a collection of the dreams of beings instead of its own distinct realm with laws, ect... it is dependent on the dreamers mind or the creature influencing its mind.</p>

<h3> | Miscellaneous |</h3>
<p align="justify">This category is for miscellaneous things, like really dumb myths and joke characters, basically useless and just for fun not even actual writing, some may be actual myths but typically these are jokes not meant for anything. Typically the people of this world do believe in them.</p>

<h3>Neoan</h3>
<p align="justify">Neoan myths and legends</p>

<h4>Aedonian Wolf</h4>
<p align="justify">
I don't think this story is good but here
<br>
The story of the Aedonian wolf of Avalon, it was said that when the Neoan legend Avalon first arrived in the primitive region of Aedon he had found a lone wolf cub, taking it in and raising it like one of his pets, and sometimes even treating it like a child Avalon raised the wolf cub into a fierce but gentle wolf. Since Avalons disappearence from the world the wolf has been searching for him with its own pack, never ending its search, never resting until it has found him. Even now the wolf still hunts today forever searching.
<br><br>
The boy and wolf. A young boy by the name of Aaron, wandering throughout the woods after swearing he wished his parents were dead, his parents were not even searching for the boy, eventually he found himself lost, alone, and scared, hunted by the creatures of the night after almost being completely ripped apart by a vampire, the boy was saved when a wolf pulled the vampire away from him, the vampires flesh began to burn as if sunlight had touched him his wounds becoming worse every second, eventually fleeing from the fight realizing that the wolf had done something to him. The wolf comforted the boy and picked him up carrying him back to his home and gently placing him within the arms of his parents, warning them that they should never let a boy wander in the woods at night, alone in the dark.
