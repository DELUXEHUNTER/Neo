Welcome, I hope you enjoy reading/adding to the lore, the lore may not be the best we are trying our best to keep the lore followable and easily readable with the least amount of confusion or explanations. Most lore entries wthin this file are ideas made or suggested by the community and our plan is it include most lore here inside of the game either in books found or through exposure by characters, items, or other means. 

Most entries wthn this file are going to be written as if they were written before the starting date of the game[September 1st Monday, Apafi(01).] Entries meant specifically for Neoa are most likely going to have more lore due to Neoa being the main setting the story takes place in. 
<!-- 
  Lore Guide: 
This Guide tells you the basics of how to contribute lore such as restrictons, ect... its very basic for now and might change in the future but for now this is all that will be explained if you have more questions join the server. 
Remember the number one rule[more of a request]. At least read a few of the entries here especially if you are making lore.

  Additions and Edits: 
If you are interested in writing lore, you are completely allowed and are even encouraged to do so. There are not many restrictions, as long as your entry follows the established story from other entries or your entry does not contradict another earlier made entry than you are completely able to edit or write lore. 
It is recommended you read other enties before editing or adding an entry in order to help you avoud making mistakes that might cause your entry to be removed/declined

  Rewrites:
Rewriting entries is something that would really help us, you are able to rewrite an entry to give it more clarity by simply rewriting them in another way. Keeping its original meaning but still allowing it to be more readable and comprehendable too. 

  Explained in game Entries: 
These lore entres will be explained through the game and are typically written by code contributers, or major contributers. T

  Restrictions:
Entries that have been used as a base for several different entries cannot be changed or removed without permission and plans to remake the other entries. Due to the fact that if you change or remove an entire entry this would cause major confusion and the story would begin to fall apart because those entries have become an integral it is impossible to remove them. Adding entries is entirely acceptable again as long as you follow the rest of the story and other entries meaning at least read the background and some of the Neoan Kingdoms entries if you plan to add a character to Neoa, or make them ethnically a Neoan. This will help your entry be more likely to be accepted/Not removed.

### Background
The Lands of Neoa is based inside of a world called Ethran, A world filled with many legendary creatures, mythologies, mysteries and legends. Aswell as massive kingdoms, cities, towns and unique people. The world is set entirely in darkness after a mysterious force caused the sun to disappear from the sky putting the world into an eternal moonlit darkness. Its unknown what caused this darkness but it has been speculated that the creatures who were born underneath the Grace of Darkness caused the suns disappearence as they are able to be more adctive since gaining a massive advantage the neverending night. But this led to the people of Ethran creating new ways or methods to protect themselves from these creatures using magic to create a kind of sun magic that does not require the energies of the sun to function. In order to repel the creatures ensuring they do not harm them in their sleep, these methods are very effective but do not always work and people do still lose thier lives. The creatures who were born from darkness's grace are not inherently evil but are painted as if they are evil leading to their persecutions and murder because this is the view the people of Ethran have of them.
<br><br>
There are many similarities to the realm world there may not be many of them but there are a few. In order to make the time system easier, days, weeks, and months are used while years are replaced with terms. An example is the starting date. Monday, September 1st, Apafi. Apafi is considered year 01, being the first year ever counted. Past years were not counted in any way there were only months and days.

### The Kingdom of Neoa
<!-- Rewrite for clarity and just better writing NEEDED -->
The Kingdom of Neoa. Sometimes known as the Aedonian Kingdom or greater Aedon depending on the region you are in. It is one of the most prominent and largest kingdoms within Ethran, due to its many advancements in its society, and government meaning it is the most well established kingdom. Even perfecting the magic used to mimic the sun protecting people from the creatures born from the grace of darkness. 
Neoa has many different landscapes with unique creatures and legendary beings, alongside its rich history filled with wars, adventures, and many great heroes since before the founding of the capital city, Aedon. Neoa has the most well established legal, economic, political and militaristic structures/systems. While having a court system, law enforcers have the ability to sentence criminals to some kind of punishment. The government of Neoa is split into several different divisions while not technically a federal monarchy the kingdom is divided in the same way a federal government is, while not having governers over states, cities and towns are able to pass and enforce their own local laws while still following Royal law or technically federal law.

#### Aedon
Aedon is the founding city of the kingdom, originally built by the original Neoan king Avalon, to this day it remains the largest city within Neoa, aswell as home of every Royal Neoan Family to ever have been on the throne. Aedon due to its high status has always been the capital of Neoa, even sometimes Neoa being considered greater Aedon, or The Kingdom of Aedon due to its status as the very first city. Being the capital the laws inside of Aedon are much more strict than most cities or regions within Neoa, many guilds, organizations, and institutions are based within Aedon. 

#### Aedonian Royal Guard
The Aedonian royal guard is the highest trained order of knights, and soldiers within Neoa, and some would say within the entirety of Ethran, this does not mean they are the best and most elite but they are extremely powerful when compared to most others. The Royal Guard is based in Aedonian hence the name "Aedonian Royal Guard". There are several ranks inside of the royal guard.

#### Flame of Aedon[Temp name]
The Flame of Aedon is a radical order of humans made up of Anaxians and many other people from the many kingdoms of Ethran with their sole goals being the eradication of all non human races from the realm, and to bring back the sun. The Order is split up into several sects that are attempting to obtain these goals through different means. Not many people know of the existence of this order, and typically it is mistaken that The Anaxian Revolutionaries are a sect while they are actually an entirely seperate group of people with completely different goals. Its unknown if this mistake is purposefully apart of the facade set by the order to redirect blame for their actions.


---------------------------------------------------------------

### Anaxia
Anaxia is the kingdom located directly next to Neoa being the third most prominent kingdom within Ethran, having one of the longest and most violent rivalries with Neoa for several hundreds of years. Anaxia in recent years has become ruled over by warlords instead of the government, due to a collapse said to have been caused by Neoan operatives. This is why many Anaxians are violent and disrespectful towards Neoans.

#### Anaxian Revolutionaries
The Anaxian revolutionaries are a group of Anaxians, and other nationalities mainly made up of Anaxians. This group is violent and extreme oposing everything the Neoan government does even starting small skirmishes between them and the guards/army.

--------------------------------------------------------------- 

### Dimensions/Realms
The alternate dimensions and realms of Ethran, the main dimension.

#### Aonis,<br>Liminal Realm
Aonis is a realm filled with mysteries and mind bending landscapes almost completely impossible for a normal human undead or alive, to navigate. The main purpose for this realm existing is used as a prison while its secondary purpose is used as a way to travel between locations and several other dimensions of Ethran, including the dream realm. Its extremely dangerous to travel within due to its hostile ecosystem and animals, alongside its extremely unpredictable landscape and pathways. Aonis is used to imprison beings of all races and power levels typically they are beings who have enraged gods or powerful magic beings, not even any of the gods have dominion over this realm. Magic used within Aonis is extremely volatile and almost uncastable and is very difficult for any being not native to the realm. 
Magic used to travel between realms including versions of astral project are entirely unuseable to exit, enter or travel around Aonis as if it was easily useable just any creature could escape its grasp. There are not many ways to exit or leave Aonis, but the only ways are to be pulled inside by one of the Jailors of the realm. Or through entering the gateway, if you have been pulled within the realm it will be very difficult for you to escape. The other way to exit or enter are through the many gateways located within the realm and outside of it.

<!--#### Vastille
Realm of the dead? Realm of the Undead? Ideas needed-->

#### Dream Realm
<!--I don't have many ideas for this -->
The dream realm is a collection of every dream of almost every being where they reside and form, there are no beings that truly govern over the dream realm, as each dream is considered its own subrealm or division/domain within the realm. While no being truly govern the realm beings with suffecient power like demons, or deities could influence it, or another creatures dream, each dream has its own unique properties depending on the mind of the dreamer or the influence that cause the dream such as magic, environment, ect.. Its very rarely possible to lose control over your own dream, but typically this means you must have control over your dream at first most dreamers are unaware of this possibility. Demons or other entities that enter your dream can possibly influence your dreams and turn them into nightmares, or take entire control of your dream.
Mortals typically do not know much about the dream realm and its very rare they even know of the existence of the realm outside of their typical dream. Traveling to the dream realm is very easy through the right means, astral projection is typically the most common and safest but it is possible to transport your physical body into a dream. But physically traveling has several consequences having your physical body means that you are capable of truly dying inside of the realm, it also takes a heavy toll on your mind and body if you do travel. Its recommended that if you do travel you are well experienced and strong willed. Otherwise you should not be going into the dream realm. Just as the realm Aonis is unpredictable so is the dream realm in some cases even more than Aonis.


---------------------------------------------------------------

### Characters
These are the characters and creatures of the world.

#### The mysterious voice/Mystical Voice
This mysterious voice guides you in your adventure, rarely speaking to you its unknown if it has malicious intents or intends to help you throughout. Its unknown if the voice is an all powerful being who gave you life from nothing... or took life from someone else to give you a life. 
Its best you continue to follow its advice and leadership. This voice could either be an all powerful being or it could be one of your ancestors guiding you in your new found life.

#### Lexian II,<br>The King of Neoa.
<!-- Entire rewrite wanted -->
Lexian the second shown by his name is the second in his family a Neoan king and the youngest Neoan to ever be crowned the king. Having been given his crown at the young age of 14 after his fathers mysterious disappearence, he is now currently 24, and has become well known for his many improvements and changes inside of the Neoan kingdom including redefining the way the economy and government is regulated, introducing several regulations and laws that have brought Neoan citizens safer lives and better economic stability. Not much is known about him by the mainstream population due to his royal status meaning he is not very well known personally by many people, except for those he directly finds an interest in or his family more specifically. Lexian has survived two assasinations attempts by Anaxian rebels. 

#### Kain Sovin,<br>The royal Guard
Kain is the royal guard that the king has entrusted his life to for several years, he is sometimes a very kind and gentle person while others being one of the rudest people, he is very loyal to the Neoan crown despite being an Anaxian by right of his parents he was born and raised a Neoan child. Kain is the only living of his family left.
 
#### Dex,<br>The Bounty Hunter
Dex is one of the highly skilled bounty hunters within Ethran credited with claiming some of the most dangerous and notorious bounties within Ethran. He is very well known and respected within most kingdoms, and their cities, its unknown how he gained a large reputation as one of the most respected bounty hunters despite being the most arrogant and rude Anaxians to exist. Its suspected that Dex has several ties to the Anaxian revolutionaries, but this is entirely unknown and possibly false due to Dex being known to work for the Neoan government several times in the past. This is either due to him being entirely motivated by greed or having no politicial connections. 

### Ancient Ancestors
These are the ancestors who almost all people within Ethran share within their blood through distant or direct connections.

#### Avalon,<br>Neoan Lord
<!--Unremovable-->
Avalon is the founder and first king of Neoa being the greatest king in Neoan History, he has been immortalized in Neoan history through thousands of stories and legends told over hundreds of years even being considered an Anaxian hero in some parts of Anaxia, and Neoa. Several Neoans are directly related to him through distant connections and few through direct. Avalon did not die, he disappeared one day. Its unknown where he went but many speculate he entered the realm of Aonis and stayed there, but this is almost impossible to prove as no one has ever explored Aonis to this extent, or ever even spoken to the beings that reside there.  

#### Iedelan,<br>Anaxian hero
<!--Needs Lore -->
Iedelan is the most famous hero within Anaxia, he is known for slaying demons and many other immortal creatures within Anaxia, Iedelan is said to have been named after a god by the same name. 

#### Tau-an,<br>The Undead.
<!--Idea Entry-->
Tau-an is the immortal undead ancestor of almost all things dead. He is considered the very first undead aswell as creator and master of the first undead beings, until being overthrown by the very creatures he raised from the dead. The more he experimented with necromancy the more powerful beings he was capable of creating, such as vampires, eventually he became capable of create new life from death, each time he raised the dead he lost more and more of his sanity as he began surrounding himself by these creatures pushing himself away from the living until his eventual passing where he brought himself back from the dead. Its said that he is contained within the realm of Aonis. But its unknown where he actually is located or living within. Undead do not follow his lordship otherwise he would've been freed. Some people believe that Tau-an is the original human, but this is a widely disproven theory and is completely false. Its just a belief people have
