# Writing Guide
There is no specific restriction or way to write the lore for this game, you may write it however you want, because I know no matter what I do my entries into this will be mediocre when compared to what other people may write. Anyone may add anything they want into a lore entry, and almost everything written here will be added to the game, unless specified otherwise. a [PLACEHOLDER] Means that there is not name or entry for the object, if a placeholder has an entry it will have a link under it linking to the entry(if I figure out how to link headings which I think I know how but I don't feel like doing it right now), numbers inside of a [] like [PLACEHOLDER1] mean nothing but could be used if you don't feel like editing this yourself but have an idea for a name, you can just type it out in one of the discussions or link an issue.

In order to avoid overwhelming readers, and writers alike if this file becomes too large I will split the file into several other ones giving each file their own category, some files may take two categories but I'm unsure on how I want to do this hopefully I figure it out in the future. Hopefully I can find a way to structure these files in a way that doesn't seem off, or too stylish, as I want neither.

I again want to apologize for the horrible grammar and just overall story. I'm not good with grammar or writing in general, my ideas are seemingly dumb, but I had them so I will use them the best I can, I'll try to keep the story as followable as I can.

### Background
The world of [PLACEHOLDER], is one filled with many creatures, and realms from mystery, mythology and legend, unique animals, massive kingdoms, cities, towns, people even. Some similiarities to the real world is the system used to tell is month and day, with the exception of a number year instead replaced with a term or word for each year the current date is: September, Monday the 1st, of the year Apafi[Y01](I don't know where I got the idea for the name Apafi). The entire world is set into an eternal darkness, it is unknown who, how, or what caused this to occur but it has been like this for years the people of [PLACEHOLDER] have found many ways to live with this and dispel/repel dark creatures that live in the night. 

The world of [PLACEHOLDER2]is filled with many realms, and dimensions accessable to some powerful people, filled with massive kingdoms, cities, towns, many animals, people, creatures, ect..... This catagory is meant for describing the world around Neoa. The world is eternally night due to the absence and disappearence of the sun, typically this absense is associated with vampiric and lycan entities, causing them to be naturally shunned by societies around the world. Neoa especially. 


### NEOA 
Neoa is a massive kingdom, in the realm of [PLACEHOLDER1], filled with creatures and beings from legends and mythologies around the world. Neoa is typically seen as the most prominent and well known kingdoms in the entirety of 
[PLACEHOLDER1], Surrounded by many kingdoms.

#### Nightcreature Policies
For several decades the presence of creatures like lycans, and vampires were not persecuted by the government. While still not legally allowed within cities, or towns, in recent decades many laws have been pased
