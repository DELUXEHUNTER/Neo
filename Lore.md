# Writing Guide
There is no specific restriction or way to write the lore for this game, you may write it however you want, because I know no matter what I do my entries into this will be mediocre when compared to what other people may write. Anyone may add anything they want into a lore entry, and almost everything written here will be added to the game, unless specified otherwise.

[PLACEHOLDER] Means that there is not designated name, numbers inside of a [] like [PLACEHOLDER1] mean nothing but could be used if you don't feel like editing this yourself but have an idea for a name


If this file fills up too much I will go through and create several seprate files for different aspects of the game, Items, people, places/locations, ect.... 

## WORLD
<div>MEDIEVAL FANTASY</div>
The world of **[PLACEHOLDER1]** is filled with many realms, and dimensions accessable to some powerful people, filled with massive kingdoms, cities, towns, many animals, people, creatures, ect..... 

Neoa is a massive kingdom, in the realm of **[PLACEHOLDER2]**, filled with creatures and beings from ledgends and mythologies around the world. Neoa is surrounded by several kingdoms. The player is able to go to these kingdoms and influence them in various ways. These kingdoms are unnamed until someone decides to name them.
