# Lore Guide

There are absolutely no restrictions to what entries you may add, or edit. As long as you maintain relevancy to the main story and other lore entries than you may add anything you want. It is suggested you read the other entries before adding lore, or discuss your addition in discussions. 

Each entry that is made will be reviewed at least one, before being added to this file.

For the first stages of this game my main focus will be the lore for neo, so the rest of the universe may not be fully written which is why I'm giving anyone the oppurtunity to write lore


**Note:until people make contributions everything in this file will be written by me, the owner. And I'm sorry if the lore isn't good or if my writing is hard to follow, I'm not a very good writer.** 

## Stellar level 
The areas around the planet Neo. 
#### Interspace
Interspace is the region within space that the story takes place within, filled with planets hospitable and inhospitable, home to many corporate entities, pirates, government facilities, and organizations, ect... despite being descovered hundreds of years ago the entirety remains unexplored, and uncolonized. Although this is mainly due to the size of the region and the many conflicts that have taken place. 

#### New Axis
Axis, the home planet of Axians, the closest neighbors to both the Neoans, and Aurelians. Typically considered the sister, and in some cases the brother planet of Neo, having similiar weather, a similar ecosystem, and environment. Axis is considered the only place to be both more dangerous and safer than the planet of Neo. Axians are responsible for the discovery and colonization of Neo, specifically credited to the Exeon corporation.

#### Aurelia
Aurelia, is the well known home planet of the Aurelians, the aurelians are almost completely isolated from the Interspace by choice of their government. Also another of the close neighbors to Axis, and Neo. Aurelia is almost completely underwater, and is typically considered quite peaceful, until the sun is down, which is most of the time on aurelia due to Aurelia being behind both Neo, and Axis.

Anything relating to on, in, or directly around the planet Neo.
