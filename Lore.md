# Lore Guide
There are almost zero restrictions to what you entries you may add to the lore, as long as you maintain relevancy to the main story/other lore entries, you don't have to read the other entries to add your own but it is highly suggested you at least read a few of them so that you will have a better chance of having your entry accepted.  Each entry will be reviewed at least once before being accepted.

Another note, until people make contributions everything in this file will be written by me, the owner. And I'm sorry if the lore isn't good or if my writing is hard to follow, I'm not a very good writer 

# Stellar level 
The region neo is located in, or around Neo, not directly focused on the planet of neo
#### Interspace
The region within space that everything in this game/story happens, filled with planets both inhospitable and hospitable alike, Interspace is home to many corporate entities, pirates, government facilities, and so on, most of the region is unexplored and uncolonized, despite being discovered hundreds of years ago, although this is due to the size of the region and many conflicts that have taken place. Almost half of the region remains unexplored
