# Neo
Welcome to neo, a simple C# game that I will be developing completely online, not in the sense that the game runs online, in the sense that the game is developed using the web editor. I've never developed a game of any kind and I'm hoping that this game will be somewhat enjoyable and the narrative will be followable and coherant. It may not function properly but I will try my best. This is one of the first games, if anyone would like to help me than please do I'd really appreciate tbe help, contributions are welcome for anyone, I would really appreciate it, but otherwise I will be working on this game entirely on my own until someone helps.

#### The beginning 
You start out with selecting your characters name, and gender, it is recommended your first and last name be 6 characters otherwise it could end up like this 





### To-Do/Things I need help with:
* TOP PRIORITY:Type Animation/slow print animation
- I will not be making this type animation because it ruins the text everytime I attempt to use it, I end up ruining the code.
* Literally everything 
* Lore writing having an actual good idea for lore while sticking with my vision.
* Lore Writing to actually make most of the game
* Health, combat, ect...
* Save system.
* More character creation options
* Character creation actually working
* Seperate files

### Future Plans:
A text based roleplay with many mechanics, ect... actual effects from having your selected character


### Short Lore:
Based in the planet neo a planet with freezing cold tempuratures and an inhospitable enviroment. Lores not really written or thought of but this is the basis.
