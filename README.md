<!--- A note for anyone who contributes to this game in the future, as of now February 13th 2024 I will have to leave in a few months for three months and I will be unable to access any of my electronic devices except for my phone, which I will be unable to use github, discord, or anything that is not google docs or call and messaging service. I'm extremely sorry for this inconvincience and I hope it doesn't cause too many problems. -->

Neo<br>Land of Neoa</h1>
Welcome to the land of Neoa. The first game I've ever made, or worked on, it might not be the best game I'll ever make, or the best game i've ever made but I'm trying my hardest to do my best and make this game. This isn't going to be something that is worked on every single day, so it might take some time to develop. All we are trying to do is have fun making this game giving people something to do when their bored.<br>
A future thank you to anyone who contributes thank you all for your hard work, I genuinely appreciate it and I want you to know I couldn't have done it without you all. And heres a thank you to anyone who plays the game, that means a lot too because we have put a lot of time into making this game and it means a lot that you play and enjoy our game.

There are many plans for this game that will help keep the game interesting like future DLCS(not really DLCS) that we will be making in the future. Alongside many other things like unique modes. For now we will be working on the base game, for obvious reasons a game shouldn't have addons until fully developed. Now here are a few of our future plans with this game, the main plan for this game is to have a long playable text based game with some fights/encounters and many different semi-unique systems, aswell as eventually making this game playable online in a browser. Hopefully neoa will have a comphrendable story and lore for all to enjoy. 
Sometime in the very distant future(1-2 years) this game will move from being a text based CLI game, into something I forgot what its called but it will be similar in the way Catacylse DDA is using that as an example because I'm unsure of what their called. It will remain an ASCII game.
