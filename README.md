<!--- A note for anyone who contributes to this game in the future, as of now February 13th 2024 I will have to leave in a few months for three months and I will be unable to access any of my electronic devices except for my phone, which I will be unable to use github, discord, or anything that is not google docs or call and messaging service. I'm extremely sorry for this inconvincience and I hope it doesn't cause too many problems. -->

This is a text-based game made using C#/Csharp. It is also the first game I have ever developed and tried to make. It might not be the best game ever, but we are trying to make it as fun and as playable as we possibly can. There are many plans for this game in the very distant and near future that we hope will improve the game even more. A future thank you to anyone who contributes to the game in the distant future. It means a lot.
