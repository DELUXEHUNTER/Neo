# Neoa.


Welcome to Neo. A simple console C# game. It is still being made and is not going to be the best game but I will be trying my best to make a playable somewhat good game the best I can. This is my first game I've ever made and I hope it is good and the narrative is somewhat followable and coherent, but I'm not the best at developing games, or writing. If anyone would like to contribute to the lore, or development of this game[or whatever its called] you are welcome to. 

Currently rewriting the entire game.


### To-Do/Things I need help with:
- TOP PRIORITY <a href="https://github.com/DELUXEHUNTER/neo/blob/Master/Lore.md">Lore writing</a>
- Save System/Progress restore


**IMPORTANT:** Sometime in a few months I will have to leave for 3 months and will not be able to access any of my electronic devices. I don't expect anyone to want to help with this project/game but if you do remember this, and when I do come back I'll review everything and start coding again.
