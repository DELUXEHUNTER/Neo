# Neo, C# Game 
Welcome to Neo, a simple C# game that I will be developing completely online, not in the sense that the game runs online but in the sense that the game is developed using the web editor. I've never developed a game of any kind, and I'm hoping that this game will be somewhat enjoyable and the narrative will be followable and coherent. It may not function properly, but I will try my best. This is one of the first games. If anyone would like to help me, then please do. I'd really appreciate the help. Contributions are welcome for anyone; I would really appreciate it, but otherwise I will be working on this game entirely on my own until someone helps. If you come across this, I hope you enjoy playing, and if you have suggestions for lore or anything like that, then let me know and I'll be glad to add them.

### To-Do/Things I need help with:
* TOP PRIORITY: Type Animation/Slow print animation.
* Lore writing
* Health, combat, rpg mechanics in general
* Save System/Progress restore
* Character creation

### Short Lore:
Just a short note, I'm not very good at writing, or ideas, especially names,  so if the lore seems horrible its probably because I've been working on it entirely by myself, or been getting horrible suggestions now for the actual lore: The planet of Neo, a massive planet with several corporations on its surfuce. The planet of Neo is the equivelant of a frozen wasteland with nothing on its surface except dangerous ice, and liquid nitrogen rains that sometimes melt through the carbon suits worn by any traveler outside of the safe subterranean colonies under the planetary surface. Neo despite being almost completely inhospitable is one of the richest planets in the interspace region. Located beside New Axi, and the Loi station.
