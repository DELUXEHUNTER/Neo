# Neo
Welcome to neo, a simple C# game that I will be developing completely online, not in the sense that the game runs online, in the sense that the game is developed using the web editor. I've never developed a game of any kind and I'm hoping that this game will be somewhat enjoyable and the narrative will be followable and coherant. It may not function properly but I will try my best. This is one of the first games, if anyone would like to help me than please do I'd really appreciate tbe help, contributions are welcome for anyone, I would really appreciate it, but otherwise I will be working on this game entirely on my own until someone helps.

#### The beginning 
You start out with selecting your characters name, and gender, it is recommended your first and last name be 6 characters otherwise it could end up like this:

After naming your character you will get to select your gender, and once the other character creation options are added, you will be able to select your ethnicity, and species, maybe even your age if I decide to but the more options I decide to add the more difficult it will be for me to code the many options that will be available within the game, so for now the game will stick to having a few options until someone would like to help me code them. I plan on spending a lot of time on this but I'm not going to waste time doing that until the basegame is entirely finished. Or almost entirely finished.  



### To-Do/Things I need help with:
* TOP PRIORITY: Type Animation/Slow print animation.
* Lore writing
* Health, combat, rpg mechanics in general
* Save System
* Character creation
* Gender selection failing to work properly the first time.

### Future Plans:
A text based roleplay with many mechanics, ect... actual effects from having your selected character, for now it is a te


### Short Lore:
Based in the planet neo a planet with freezing cold tempuratures and an inhospitable enviroment. Lores not really written or thought of but this is the basis.
