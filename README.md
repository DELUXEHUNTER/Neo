# Neoa.

Welcome to Neo. A simple console C# game. It is still being made and is not going to be the best game but I will be trying my best to make a playable somewhat good game the best I can. This is my first game I've ever made and I hope it is good and the narrative is somewhat followable and coherent, but I'm not the best at developing games, or writing. If anyone would like to contribute to the lore, or development of this game you are welcome to. 

In the future I plan to turn this game into a full RPG with character creation and everything beyond giving yourself a name.  Alongside adding combat and other random encounters that could happen in your adventure but for now I will stick with just developing a basic text narrative. And then from there I hopefully will have people willing to help me code the RPG Version of the game in the distant or maybe near future depending on the amount of help, people who actually like this game. 

And with that finished I'd like to thank you for reading, and I hope if you feel like helping me, you will. If not I hope you enjoy playing my game. 


### To-Do/Things I need help with:
* TOP PRIORITY <a href="https://github.com/DELUXEHUNTER/neo/blob/Master/Lore.md">Lore writing</a>
* Save System/Progress restore

**IMPORTANT** Sometime in a few months I will have to leave for 3 months and will not be able to access any of my electronic devices. I don't expect anyone to want to help with this project/game but if you do remember this, and when I do come back I'll review everything and start coding again.
