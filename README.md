Welcome to Neo, a simple C# game that I am going to be making completely online, so it may not function properly, but I will try my best to make a good game that someone will find and enjoy playing or even help me make. It might not be good, but I'm learning, and this is my first game of any type of code. Hopefully, when it's done, you will enjoy it. Check the To-Do list to see the features that need to be added. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the game as long as they do not ruin the game for others.
