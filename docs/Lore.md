<h1 align="left"> Writing Guide</h1>

<p align="justify">There is no specific restriction or way to write the lore for this game, you may write it however you want, because I know no matter what I do my entries into this will be mediocre when compared to what other people may write. Anyone may add anything they want into a lore entry, and almost everything written here will be added to the game, unless specified otherwise. a [Placeholder] Means that there is not name or entry for the object, if a placeholder has an entry it will have a link under it linking to the entry(if I figure out how to link headings which I think I know how but I don't feel like doing it right now), numbers inside of a [] like [Placeholder1] mean nothing but could be used if you don't feel like editing this yourself but have an idea for a name, you can just type it out in one of the discussions or link an issue.</p> 

<p align="justify">In order to avoid overwhelming readers, and writers alike if this file becomes too large I will split the file into several other ones giving each file their own category, some files may take two categories but I'm unsure on how I want to do this hopefully I figure it out in the future. Hopefully I can find a way to structure these files in a way that doesn't seem off, or too stylish, as I want neither. I again want to apologize for the horrible grammar and just overall story. I'm not good with grammar or writing in general, my ideas are seemingly dumb, but I had them so I will use them the best I can, I'll try to keep the story as followable as I can. I hope you enjoy reading </p>
